==================================================================
Let me define some ordering of which functions can be done when
==================================================================

There are two types of daughter cards:

1)  fe1 = daughter card for Drift Chamber, Time-Expansion Chamber, and Pad Chamber, MuID
	-In order to read fake or real data, no specific memories need to be loaded...
        -In order to zero suppress data, you must load threshold memory only (no List/Ped)...  

2)  fe2 = daughter card for TOF(AMU Cell based), EMCal, RICH, MVD, BB, MuTR
	-In order to read fake data or real data out, you must load list memory...
	-In order to zero suppress data, you must load list, pedestal and threshold memory also...

You are not required to read any of the memories back, it is just for checking...
You can download and upload any memories (List,Pedestal,Threshold) in any order and
as many times as you want after the (1)(2)(3) sequence is done...

Right now you have an fe1 card for Drift Chamber. 7/12/98
