<font size="5" color="navy"><u>Directory Structure</u></font>
<p>
The threshold files are kept in <font color="blue">$DCM_THRESHOLDS</font>,
and they are organized into subdirectories by granule name.  Below is a
directory listing of these subdirectories as of 18 June, 2001.
</p>

<pre><font color="red">
phoncs0:thresholds&gt; ls
bb/       emc.e.t/  emc.w.t/  rich.e/   tec.e/    zdc/
emc.e.b/  emc.w.b/  mutr.s/   rich.w/   tof.e/
</font>
</pre>

<font size="5" color="navy"><u>Naming Convention</u></font>
<p>
The threshold files are kept under these subdirectories.  They are named
according to packet id, with the name
</p>

<pre><font color="red">
	$DCM_THRESHOLDS/&lt;granuleName&gt;/&lt;detname&gt;&lt;packetid&gt;.thresh
        e.g.,
	$DCM_THRESHOLDS/zdc/zdc13001.thresh
</font>
</pre>

<p>
Actually, the threshold files are set in the pcf configuration file.
The <font color="blue">threshold1</font> field contains the threshold filename
for the first packet in a multiplex, and the <font color="blue">threshold2</font>
field contains the filename for the second packet.  A name of "tnull" indicates
no file has been set.  As you can see, we have
conveniently chosen a directory structure and file names that will help to keep
things organized, <font color="red">so DON'T change the threshold filename
in the pcf files</font>.  You should instead replace the files in the threshold directory
when you need a new set of thresholds.
</p>

<font size="5" color="navy"><u>Threshold File Format</u></font>
<p>
There is one threshold file per packet.  The files are plain ascii files,
with one threshold value per line.  The ordering of the channels is the same
as that given in the <a href="https://phenix-intra.sdcc.bnl.gov/phenix/project_info/electronics/dcm/DCM_formats/PHENIX_Formats/">DCM documentation
for the data formats</a>.  There should be as many lines in the file as there are
channels in one packet of data.  In the <a href="https://phenix-intra.sdcc.bnl.gov/phenix/project_info/electronics/dcm/DCM_formats/PHENIX_Formats/">
DCM format documentation</a> there is also a list of the hit formats which support
zero-suppression and details on the suppression algorithm, which you will need to
read in order to understand what the threshold settings should be.
</p>

<p>
An example file for the ZDC is given <a href="https://phenix-intra.sdcc.bnl.gov/phenix/project_info/electronics/dcm/zdc_thresholds.html">here</a>.
There are only 8 values for the 8 channels of the ZDC.  The threshold on the
first line, 3910, gets applied to the first zdc channel, the threshold on the
second line gets applied to the second channel, etc.  Simple, isn't it?  When
the DCMs are booted they get loaded into memory in the DCMs, and are
applied as the data comes in.
</p>

<font size="5" color="navy"><u>Procedure for data taking</u></font>
<p>
It is the responsibility of the subsystems to make sure that the threshold files
are in place before a zero-suppressed run begins.  This of course includes detailed
study with beam conditions.  When a run is started, all the threshold values
will be recorded into the online database.  Martin Purschke and Sergei Belikov have
a nice set of code to do this.  These values can then be retrieved later for any
given run (more details are forthcoming on this).

<font size="5" color="navy"><u>Some Utilities</u></font>
<p>
Here are some useful utilities for dealing with the threshold configurations:
<br><br>
1. dcmthresholds.sh: This utility sets the thresholds to one flat value for all the channels in one granule.
