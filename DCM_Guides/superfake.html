The goal of superfake running is to generate fake data in the DCM dsp's as controlled via 
Run Control and then have the data go through the Event Builder and logged to disk.  This
allows DAQ system tests without running FEM's and allows one to control data size, fluctuations
and loading.

To run superfake, follow the below instructions.

1.  You need to decide which granules you want to run in superfake mode.  

2.  There is a level-1 trigger configuration called superfake1.  You need to modify
this or create a new one (using the standard level-1 gui interface) so that Partition #2 
includes all the granules you want to run in superfake mode.  Make sure to use Partition #2.

3.  You need to modify the online_configuration/rc/hw/superfake.pcf file.  In that ascii file
at the top there are a set of #defines which are commented out.  Just put back in the lines

#define SUPERFAKE
#define SUPERFAKE_GL1

and the appropriate lines for the granules you want to run.  

NOTE THAT WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED RUNNING SUPERFAKE, YOU !!! MUST !!! COMMENT THESE LINES BACK
OUT.  Otherwise the next person to try to run that subsystem with real data will get very confused.

In the near-future this problem will be removed, because you will be able to select within runcontrol
superfake and it will process the pcf files with -D SUPERFAKE.

4.  One other edit to superfake.pcf is needed.  Go to the line "#define DCM_GL1_SOURCE_ID".  You need
to figure out which granule numbers you are running (they are in the level-1 configuration gui).  
Then you need to calculate the granule accept vector.

granule_accept_vector = 0;
Loop over all granules [
   granule_accept_vector = granule_accept_vector | (1 &lt;&lt; gran_number)
]

Type this value into superfake.pcf as the DCM_GL1_SOURCE_ID (yes, it is overloaded too).

5.  Then you load the real GL1.  This is necessary even though we are not using the real GL1 data.

6.  Then load the Event Builder - it should then know about the correct partition #2 and granules.

7.  Launch the GL1 run control.  Download, but do not start running.

8.  Launch the partition #2 run control.  Download.

9.  Then you start running the partition #2 run control.  You should see that all the SEB's will fill
up with events.

10. Then start the GL1 run control immediately afterwards.  Then it will start assembling events.

--&gt; Warnings !

a.  We found a problem around event 65k.  Presumably a counter roll-over issue.  This needs to be resolved.

b.  There may be timing issues with the EvB that have not been explored in this mode.  John Haggerty and
I ran GL1, ZDC, MUTR.N and it was fine up to 65k.

--&gt; Features !

a.  In the superfake.pcf file each granule gets an overloaded hit format.  They are all 50000 + N.  This
generates a fake data packet of size N (not including the packet header).  If you want to change the event
size for a granule, just change this value in the superfake.pcf file.

b.  In the future we can add features to have the event size fluctuate independently, or have all systems
fluctuation together (simulating centrality).  Please let me (Jamie) know if you want
specific features.  We should make sure what we have works before doing too much more.
