These instructions are for running the DCM software in Stand Alone mode 
(ie. without run control).  There are two steps.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First you can select options on the readout method before you start running.
In the run control version this is done automatically.  For each granule
there is a configuration file (eg. "muid.s.pcf" which is usually a soft link to
the real file "muid.s.pcf.BASE") which is located at:

    /export/software/oncs/online_configuration/rc/hw

You can select certain readout options at this point.  You need to run a 
processing script from this directory as shown in the following examples.

    process_pcf_file -DZERO -DPAR_TCPIP muid.s.pcf

This creates the appropriate temporary muid.s granule *.dat files that exist
in the directory "/export/software/oncs/online_configuration/Dcm".  These files
are constantly overwritten by this script, so do not edit these files.  In the
above example I have selected to run with zero suppression and sending the data
to the partition module which then sends it to the crate controller and over
tcpip to a file.  If nothing was selected then you get a set of defaults.  The
following are the set of options (not available to all granules).

1.  zero suppression (either ZERO or NOZERO)
2.  data transfer method (either DSP14_TCPIP or DSP5_TCPIP or PAR_TCPIP or PAR_JSEB)
      - the last option is only when using the event builder
      - the first three options write to a file if the event builder is not used
3.  data format (either SHORT or LONG)
      - presently this is for the EMCal only
      - only the SHORT format can have the ZERO suppression working

If you do not have a pcf file for your granule, please let me know. 

Lastly, if you want to turn particular channels off and on, presently you need to
edit the pcf file.  Basically for each fiber connection there is a "readout:YES" 
or "readout:NO".  John Haggerty is working on a perl/tk gui to allow users to do 
this without hand editing the files.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second, you can run the granule.  You need to do your usual ARCNET loads and GTM
setup.  Then for the DCM portion:

1.  Login to the phoncs account on phoncs0.phenix.bnl.gov
2.  Type "setuponcs R3.0.0"  
3.  dcm MUID.S

         - just type your granule name
	 - here is a list of names:  GL1 BB ZDC MVD DC.W DC.E PC.W PC.E RICH.W RICH.E
                                     TEC.E TOF.E EMC.W.T EMC.W.B EMC.E.T EMC.E.B
                                     MUTR.S MUID.S
         - this should automatically pick up your correct temporary *.dat files
	      (again if it does not work let me know)

4.  type 0   (for interaction session)
5.  type 301 (load the files)
6.  type 303 (load the DCM boards)
7.  type 305 (to take data)
        
         - input the number of events desired
	 - input where to put the events (disk needs to be mounted eg. 
           "/export/bigdisk/phoncs")

8.  type 306 (stop run)

         - right now stop run often does not work properly.  We are working
	   on it.  If you want to start another run, just type 303 again
	   to reboot the DCM boards and then 305.
