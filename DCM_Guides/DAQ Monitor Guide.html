This routine runs in the pmon framework and checks for basic
integrity of events run in standalone mode or built through the
event builder. 
</p><p>
</p><h2>How to Run?</h2>
<p>
Login to one of the valinux cluster machines (ssh vaxx) under the
phoncs account.  
</p><pre>
&gt; setuponcs
&gt; cd ~/monitor/online/monitoring/phnxmonitor/daq
&gt; root
&gt; root [0] gSystem-&gt;Load("libDaqMon.so");
&gt; root [1] pfileopen("/common/buffer2/eventdata/EVENTDATAxxx_P05-0000022824-0000.PRDFF");
           // to read from a file
           OR
	   petopen("/tmp/Monitor@etpool");
	   // to read from the ET event pool
&gt; root [2] prun(10)
           // to read through N events (in this example N=10)
	   OR
	   pstart()
	   // to continuously read events
&gt; root [3] .x DaqMonStatus.C
           // this shows a gui update of the monitor status
	   OR
	   .L DaqMonStatusCont.C
	   loopMonitor();
	   // this give a period automatic update of the gui monitor status

</pre>
<p>
Also, the more detailed text information on specific errors is constantly
being written to an output file called "DaqMon.out" that is presently written
to the "pwd" directory.  You can run in another window "tail -f DaqMon.out" 
to see any error messages.
</p><p>
If you want to make a private version to play with you can do the following:
</p><pre>
&gt; cvs checkout online/monitoring/phnxmonitor/daq
&gt; make

</pre>
You can select any PRDF file you want and however many events you want
to check.  You can also select a pool.  You will see lots of 
printed messages that report details on 
errors found (mostly for DAQ and subsystems during debugging).  Then when
you execute the granstatus.C macro it will plot a global summary of error
conditions.  
<p>
The following is the list of checks that are currently done.  The gui display 
is shown below.  The granules are listed vertically and error conditions
horizontally.
<font color="red"><bold>
</bold></font></p><pre><font color="red">
o Exist      :  Is this granule there in the file?
o Comp       :  Are all packets expected from the detector present?
o Parity     :  Is the FEM parity word in agreement with a re-check?
o ClkSame    :  Are all FEM clock counters the same in each event?
o ClkDiff    :  Are all FEM clocks changing by the same increment between events?
o Gl1Clk     :  Are all FEM clocks changing by the same increment as the Gl1 Clock?
o EvtSeq     :  Are the FEM event counters in agreement with GL1 granule counter?
o PktHdr     :  Is the packet header length out of bounds (&gt;2000 for now)?
o DCMChk     :  The DCM's add a longitudinal XOR checksum word in the DEBUG block.
                This is then recalculated and any error must be from a bit error
		out of the DCM dsp, through the backplane readout or on the cable
		into the JSEB receiver.
o DCMSum     :  The DCM summary word is not currently being checked.

<pre>A <font color="green"><bold>GREEN</bold></font> circle means that everything is good.
A <font color="red"><bold>RED</bold></font> circle means that there is at least one error.  
A <font color="black"><bold>GREEN</bold></font> circle means that no check was done.

A few comments are worth adding here.  
1) In the case of Exist, a black circle means that the granule was not present.  
2) The parity check can only be done on data with no zero supression, except
   if the supression only removed all zero words (eg. DC, PC, MUID).
3) Some granules never have the same FEM clocks between FEMS, but they do increment
   the same between events.  In these cases we do not bother to check the ClkSame
   and the circle is black.
4) The DCM Summary error bit check is not implemented in this version.
5) If all granules have a GL1ClkDiff error, then usually the data is completely
   corrupted and the run should be stopped.  

The second display shows for each granule, the number of errors for each packet.
Plotted on the x-axis is the packet_id offset value.  The colors indicate
the number of total errors, up to seven types per packet per event.  

In the example below, you can see that the errors from panel one observed in 
MUTR granule and from just two packets.  However, the errors from the MVD are
in a large number of packets.  In order to debug problems in more detail one
needs to look out the text debug output (DaqMon.out in the same directory). 

The colors represent percentage ranges.  In the left plot it is the percentage of 
packets in that granule that have errors.  In the right plot it is the percentage 
of events that a given packets has errors in.
